# How to contribute
You are free to fork your repository and edit as you want, but you should respect the LICENSE that I've chosen. After you've done your edit, you can choose to use it 
in your project or to share them with the original project (this). I will accept every pull request that will update the system of the Project, but i will reject every
pull that will only update the code design. Please keep the code clean!
